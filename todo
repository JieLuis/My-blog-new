Development branch explanation:

main - This is for update the backbone of the application

feature/... - This is for developing the main feature of the application

bugfix/... - This is for fixing the main bug of the application

article/... - This is for updating blog

CN-pro - This is for Chinese version production

-- When ready for production, should merge 'feature/...', 'bugfix/...' and 'article/...' into CN-pro

-- After finish developing on 'feature/...', 'bugfix/...' and 'article/...', should merge them into main

-- Everytime create a new branch 'feature/...', 'bugfix/...' and 'article/...', should create them from main, so keep in mind that main should be updated before create a new branch from it
